NAME
  abcd.pl - Solves the physical formula based on a set of input physical quantities
  abcd_wiki.pl - Hash function to redirect references to physical quantities in wikipedia

DESCRIPTION
  abcd.pl - CGI sсript, written in the Perl programming language <http://www.perl.org/> 
  from 24/08/2006 <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ignat/tqxhS3aDSXM>.

  Its primary goal is to demonstrate the principle of withdrawal of simple 
  equations of theoretical physics. Script displays the System of physical quantities 
  of Plotnikov N. A. (SPQ) and clearly highlights the operators and the dependency chain.

CONTRIBUTING
  Of course anybody can contribute by reporting issues via github or fixing
  typos in the documentation. To be able to contribute with code, some rules
  need to be kept. This is mandatory for any community project. 

REST API
  While working out in beta version on the site:
  http://mc.homedevice.pro/

PLUGINS
  Planned to connect several ready plugins for node.js programming language.

CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
  We would like to know that our software is always in good health so we
  count on friendly developers and organizations to install and test it
  continuously.
  
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
  Script to suit only for local use for security reasons.
  
  Local scripts are executed with only few necessary environment variables 
  (others are removed), but otherwise have the same privileges and access to 
  system resources as the user, who started the browser. However, downloading 
  locally executed scripts from remote locations or using Perl, Python or PHP 
  interpreters as helper applications for online content are not going to be 
  implemented because of the huge security risks involved! It is also not a 
  good idea to make any folders containing locally executed scripts available 
  to web servers or file sharing applications due to the risk of executing 
  locally malicious or unsecure code uploaded from outside. 
  
HISTORY
  abcd.pl was started as a simple GUI CGI script for personal databases of 
  System of physical quantities. This small project (965 lines of code) is 
  still in its very beginning and current version (0.2.0) should be considered 
  beta pre-release. Do not use it for production purposes! 

  Exhaustive documentation is still missing and current examples are basic.
